# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical issue where product images are not displaying correctly in the Laravel application using Spatie Media Library. The problem spans across Filament admin panel image uploads, API responses, and React frontend display. The system needs to properly handle both single main images and gallery images for products, with proper storage configuration and URL generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to upload and manage product images through Filament admin panel, so that I can properly associate main and gallery images with products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin uploads a main image for a product THEN the system SHALL store it using Spatie Media Library in the 'products' collection
2. WHEN an admin uploads gallery images for a product THEN the system SHALL store them using Spatie Media Library in the 'gallery' collection
3. WHEN an admin views the product form THEN the system SHALL display existing images with proper preview functionality
4. WHEN an admin deletes an image THEN the system SHALL remove it from both the media library and file system
5. IF a product has no main image THEN the system SHALL require one before saving

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the API to return properly formatted image URLs, so that the React application can display product images correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API returns product data THEN it SHALL include properly formatted image URLs for main and gallery images
2. WHEN a product has a main image THEN the API SHALL return the full URL accessible from the frontend
3. WHEN a product has gallery images THEN the API SHALL return an array of image objects with URLs, names, and metadata
4. WHEN a product has no images THEN the API SHALL return null or empty arrays appropriately
5. WHEN requesting product lists THEN the API SHALL include image data for each product efficiently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to see product images displayed correctly on the website, so that I can view products properly before making purchase decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a product list THEN each product SHALL display its main image correctly
2. WHEN viewing product details THEN the main image SHALL be displayed prominently
3. WHEN viewing product details THEN gallery images SHALL be displayed in a carousel or grid format
4. WHEN an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder image
5. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper storage configuration and file management, so that images are stored securely and served efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the storage link SHALL be properly configured
2. WHEN images are uploaded THEN they SHALL be stored in the correct public storage directories
3. WHEN images are accessed THEN they SHALL be served with proper MIME types and caching headers
4. WHEN the system generates image URLs THEN they SHALL be accessible from the frontend domain
5. WHEN images are deleted THEN they SHALL be removed from both database and file system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper media conversions and optimization, so that images are served in appropriate sizes and formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate thumbnail and medium-sized conversions
2. WHEN serving images THEN the system SHALL provide different sizes based on usage context
3. WHEN generating conversions THEN the system SHALL optimize images for web delivery
4. WHEN images are requested THEN the system SHALL serve the most appropriate size
5. WHEN conversions fail THEN the system SHALL fallback to original images gracefully
